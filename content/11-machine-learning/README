Note: on older machines, tensorflow generates an illegal instruction
and crashes python on import.  The issue is the CPU instructions it
was compiled with.  The solution seems to be to drop down to
tensorflow 1.5:

On my system, I need to make sure I got numpy from pip (instead of the
Fedora package manager).
